a data analytics system in Python that processes structured
data of logs. Assume that logs are related to user usage of a web or mobile application. The
system can process queries so that a data analyst can explore the logs data.
The structure of a log entry is quite generic. Each log is composed of the following fields.
• arrivaltime: This field has the timestamp of the arrival of the log. It is the UNIX
timestamp. See the standard Python package time and the following code snippets for its
usage.
• user: This is a string that holds the id of the user who initiated the log.
• session: This is a integer number which represents the session number of the user.
• event: This is a string that holds the name of the event. For instance, signin, signout,
follow, or click can be some events related to a Web usage session. The names of the
event is of course domain-dependent and logs are generic in the sense that event name can
be any string.
• usrfield: This is a domain dependent field holding a integer number. For example, for the
signin event this field can hold a number showing how many unsuccessful login attempts
occurred before the user signs in.
